            <h2 class="title">Geoffrey Hamlyn</h2>
            <p class="chapter">Near the end of February 1857, I think about the 20th or so, though it don’t much matter;
                I only know it was near the latter end of summer, burning hot, with the bushfires raging like volcanoes on the ranges,
                and the river reduced to a slender stream of water, almost lost upon the broad white flats of quartz shingle</p>

            By this time I was tramping the streets again. The sight of a tailor-shop gave me a sharp longing1 to shed my rags,
            and to clothe myself decently once more. Could I afford it? No; I had nothing in the world but a million pounds.
            So I forced myself to go on by. But soon I was drifting back again. I asked if they had a misfit suit on their hands.
            The fellow I spoke2 to nodded his head towards another fellow, and gave me no answer.

            waited till he was done with what he was doing, then he took me into a back room,
            and overhauled3 a pile of rejected suits, and selected the rattiest one for me.
            I put it on. It didn't fit, and wasn't in any way attractive, but it was new,
            and I was anxious to have it; so I said with some diffidence: "
            It would be an accommodation to me if you could wait some days for the money.
            I haven't any small change about me."

                He received it with a smile, one of those large smiles which goes around all over,
                and looks like the place where you have thrown a brick in a pond;
                and then in the act of his taking a glimpse of the bill this smile froze solid,
                and turned yellow. I never before saw a smile caught like that, in perpetuity.

        <p class="aboutme-text">The fellow worked up a sarcastic4 expression of countenance5,
            and said: "Oh, you haven't? Well, of course, I'd only expect gentlemen like you to carry large change."
            I was nettled6, and said: "My friend, you shouldn't judge a stranger always by the clothes he wears.
            I am quite able to pay for this suit; I simply didn't wish to put you to the trouble of changing a large note."
            "I didn't mean any particular harm," he said, "but I might say it wasn't quite your affair to jump to the
            conclusion thatwe couldn't change any note that you might happen to be carrying around.
            On the contrary, we can." I handed the note to him, and said: "Oh, very well; I apologize."</p>
